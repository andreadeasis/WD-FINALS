## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->



The project involves creating a fully functional, multi-page website modeled after Quirk Books' official site. It includes key pages: Home, Shop, About, and Contact. The layout and styling aim to replicate the aesthetic and user experience of the original website. Responsive up until to an Ipad Pro (1024 x 1366).

The Header and Footer utilized Bootstrap for a responsive design. It is made to be simple as the original was. The homepage features a slide for the featured books, which is up to 3 and automatically changes every few seconds. For the shop, it features a banner of the Christmas Sale and the shop homepage from the Bootstrap. The about section features only the banner for Quirk Books and the image for timeline. Lastly, the Contact page has all the information you can use to contact Quirk Books. It has icons from Awesome Fonts which can be hovered over and leads to Quirk Book's social media pages.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
